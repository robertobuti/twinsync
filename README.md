# twinsync
Twinsync is a RC speed syncronizer engine, for gas &amp; electric models
target of this project is run two engines at same speed with single gas control, tipically used in bimotor or quadrimotor plane.
Second very important function of system is reduce engine speed at idle speed if the other engine is in fault, to mantain plane control.
Optionally is possible use two of this module for quadrimotor setting one unit in Master mode and second unit in slave mode.
Optionals are the glow outputs for glow engines, in this case the system drive automtic ingitions when you start engines and swith off it wehn engine is running.
