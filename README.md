# twinsync
Twinsync is a RC speed syncronizer engine, for gas &amp; electric models
target of this project is run two engines at same speed with single gas control, tipically used in bimotor or quadrimotor plane.
Second very important function of system is reduce engine speed at idle if one engine is fault, to mantain plane control.
Optionally is possible use two of these modules for quadrimotor configuration, one unit in Master mode and second unit in slave mode.
Optionals are the glow outputs for glow engines, in this case the system drive automatic ingitions when you start engines and switch off it when engine is running.

Status : project not fully tested, under development
